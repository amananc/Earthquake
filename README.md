# Earthquake
Created as part of Udacity's Android Basics by Google Nanodegree Program.

This app shows the list of earthquake which occured recently. It uses the [USGS API](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/).

# Next Steps
I have planned to make several changes and add many features in the app.

- Show notification or alarm when earthquake occures in your state.
- Providing the feature of choosing the range of magnitude which one want to see.
